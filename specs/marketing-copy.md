# Marketing Copy Guidelines

Reference document for consistent marketing language across all promotional content for howtouseinternet.com.

## Mission Statement

**One-liner:** Digital literacy for everyone. No gatekeeping, no paywalls.

**Expanded:** We live online now. We bank online, we work online, we fall in love online—and yet most of us never got the instruction manual. How To Use Internet exists to fix that. We're building free, accessible courses that give everyone the knowledge to use digital tools confidently and stay safe doing it. Because understanding the internet shouldn't require a computer science degree or a subscription fee.

## Why Digital Literacy Matters

Digital literacy isn't about knowing how to code or building websites. It's about:

- **Knowing when something's off** — That email from your "bank" that's actually a phishing attempt? Digital literacy helps you spot it before you click.
- **Using tools effectively** — AI assistants can be incredibly powerful or completely useless. The difference is knowing how to talk to them.
- **Understanding what's happening** — When you see that little padlock in your browser, do you know what it actually means? (We have a course for that.)
- **Protecting yourself and others** — Your knowledge doesn't just protect you. It protects your parents, your friends, your colleagues.

The gap between "digital natives" and "digital literates" is real. We're here to bridge it.

## Brand Voice

### The Vibe
We're the friend who happens to know a lot about this stuff and genuinely wants to help—not to show off, just because they care. We're allowed to be funny. We're allowed to be direct. We're not allowed to be condescending or boring.

### Tone Characteristics
- **Warm but not cheesy**: We care about people. We're not going to pretend otherwise.
- **Clear but not dumbed-down**: Explaining things clearly isn't the same as treating people like idiots.
- **Witty but not try-hard**: If a joke lands naturally, great. If you're forcing it, stop.
- **Honest but not preachy**: We'll tell you the truth without lecturing you about it.

### What We Sound Like
- A friend explaining tech over coffee (or drinks—we don't judge)
- Someone who's made the mistakes and wants to help you skip them
- The colleague who actually explains things instead of making you feel dumb for asking

### What We Absolutely Don't Sound Like
- "Well, actually..." (We're not here to be smarter than you)
- Tech bro enthusiasm ("This is literally going to change EVERYTHING")
- Textbook robot ("The user shall endeavor to...")
- Condescension dressed as simplicity ("Don't worry your pretty little head")

## Sample Messaging

### The Big Picture (Mission-Focused)
> Nobody taught us how to use the internet. We learned by clicking around, making mistakes, and hoping for the best. That worked for a while—but the stakes are higher now. Scams are smarter. AI is everywhere. Privacy barely exists.
>
> So we built howtouseinternet.com: free courses that teach digital literacy to everyone. No jargon, no paywalls, no prerequisites. Just the knowledge you need to use the internet with confidence.
>
> Because understanding the internet shouldn't be optional anymore.

### Course Announcement (AI Prompting)
> Ever notice how some people get incredible results from AI while you're stuck with generic nonsense?
>
> It's not luck. It's prompting.
>
> Our free course teaches you the techniques that transform AI from "meh" to "exactly what I needed." Personas, context, chain-of-thought—the stuff that actually works.
>
> Stop fighting the AI. Start working with it.

### Security Course Promotion
> Fun fact: Scammers rarely need to "hack" anything. They just need you to trust the wrong email, click the wrong link, or panic at the right moment.
>
> Our free course teaches you their playbook—so you can see the tricks before they work.
>
> Your best defense isn't antivirus software. It's knowing what to look for.

### Quick Hit (Twitter-style)
> The internet runs on trust. Scammers exploit that.
>
> The good news? Once you know their tricks, they stop working.
>
> Free course: [link]

### Humor-Forward
> Your password is your pet's name plus your birth year, isn't it?
>
> (Don't worry, we're not judging. We're here to help.)
>
> howtouseinternet.com

## Examples

### LinkedIn post:

The internet wasn't designed to be confusing. Someone just forgot to write the manual.

For years, we've accepted that "tech people" understand how the internet works and everyone else just... doesn't. That AI is magic. That encryption is too complicated to explain. That you either "get it" or you don't.

That's not how knowledge works.

You use the internet every day. You interact with AI tools, click on padlocks, navigate websites, manage passwords. You deserve to understand what's actually happening—not because it's dangerous if you don't, but because understanding the tools you use daily is empowering.

That's why we built howtouseinternet.com.

It's a free, open-source platform that explains internet concepts, AI usage, and digital technologies in plain language. No corporate agenda. No paywalls. No gatekeeping.

Current courses include:
→ How AI prompting actually works (spoiler: it's not magic, it's pattern
matching)
→ What HTTPS and encryption mean in practice (beyond "look for the padlock")
→ And yes, how to spot scams. But that's a bonus, not the whole story

We're building this in the open because digital literacy shouldn't be
proprietary knowledge. It's accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant), available in
multiple languages, and open for contributions from anyone who wants to help
demystify the internet.

If you've ever felt like tech knowledge is unnecessarily gatekept, or if you
want to actually understand the tools you use every day, check it out:
howtouseinternet.com

And if you have expertise to share? The repo is Apache 2.0 licensed.
Contributions welcome.

Because the gap isn't between "digital natives" and everyone else. It's between
people who've had things explained to them and people who haven't.

Let's close that gap.
