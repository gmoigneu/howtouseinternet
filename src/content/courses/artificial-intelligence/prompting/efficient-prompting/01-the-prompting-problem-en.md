## The prompting problem

You have probably experienced this frustration before.

You open ChatGPT, Claude, or another AI assistant with a simple request. Maybe you need help planning something, writing something, or solving a problem. You type your prompt, hit enter, and wait.

The response arrives. And it is... fine. Generic. Vague. The AI gives you a wall of obvious advice that could apply to anyone, anywhere, in any situation. It is the conversational equivalent of receiving a form letter when you expected a personal reply.

You try again. Same result. Different words, same emptiness.

At this point, you face a choice that determines everything about your relationship with AI tools. You can react in one of two ways:

**Reaction One:** Blame the AI. "This technology is overhyped. It cannot actually help with real problems. It just spits out generic nonsense." You close the tab and return to doing things the old way.

**Reaction Two:** Blame yourself. "I must be doing something wrong. Other people seem to get amazing results. What am I missing?"

Here is the good news: if you chose the second reaction, you are already on the path to mastery. The truth is that when AI gives you garbage results, the problem usually is not the AI. It is the prompt. And that means you can fix it.

Prompting is not a mysterious talent that some people have and others lack. It is a learnable skill, like writing clearly or asking good questions in a meeting. Once you understand a handful of core techniques, you will transform from someone who occasionally gets lucky with AI to someone who consistently gets exactly what they need.

### Introducing our running example

Throughout this course, we will follow one prompt from disaster to triumph. Our example is simple: planning a trip to Japan.

Here is where most people start:

> Plan me a trip to Japan.

Go ahead, try this yourself with any AI assistant. You will get something like this:

> Japan is a wonderful destination with rich culture, delicious cuisine, and stunning landscapes. Here are some popular destinations to consider:
>
> **Tokyo** - The bustling capital offers a mix of ultra-modern and traditional...
>
> **Kyoto** - Known for its classical Buddhist temples, gardens, and traditional wooden houses...
>
> **Osaka** - Famous for its food scene and friendly locals...
>
> For your trip, consider:
> - Spring (March-May) for cherry blossoms
> - Fall (October-November) for autumn colors
> - Plan for 1-2 weeks to see major highlights
> - Budget approximately $150-300 per day depending on your travel style...

Is this response wrong? No. Is it helpful? Barely. It is the kind of generic advice you could find on the first page of any travel website. The AI has no idea who you are, what you like, how much money you have, or what "trip to Japan" means to you specifically.

By the end of this course, you will transform this useless prompt into something that generates a detailed, personalized, day-by-day itinerary that actually reflects your preferences, constraints, and travel style. And more importantly, you will understand the principles well enough to apply them to any AI interaction.

Let us begin.

### Exercise: Establish your baseline

Before we go further, try your own basic prompt. Pick something you actually want help with, whether it is planning a project, writing something, or solving a problem.

Write the simplest version of that prompt and submit it to an AI assistant. Save the response somewhere.

As you work through this course, you will return to this prompt and improve it. By the end, you will have concrete proof of how much better your prompting has become.
