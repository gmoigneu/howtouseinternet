      <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>

      <p>Since we do not collect any data, there is no data to store. Our website is purely static and does not require any server-side data processing or storage.</p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Hosting</h3>

      <p>Our website is hosted on third-party infrastructure.

Please refer to their privacy policy for more information.</p>

      <h3>3.2 External Links</h3>

      <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
